# Taily Daily dog coffee shop

## Description
"Taily Daily is a web application designed for users to explore dogs available for adoption in nearby shelters and schedule visits. It features a user-friendly interface that allows users to filter by coffee and dog options while providing detailed information about each dog."

## Features
- Book a dog
- Display detailed dog information (description, characteristics, location, etc.)
- Navigate through pages with Back/Next buttons
- View images of all dogs near the user's location
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Internet connection (for API calls)
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text) if you want to make changes

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Elena-Nam/Open-API-Project.git
   ```
2. Create a `config.js` file inside the /js directory of your cloned project with your API key:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
       API_KEY: 'your_api_key_here'
   };
   ```
   Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key from [ADOPT-A-PET API](https://www.adoptapet.com/dog-adoption).

## Running the Application
